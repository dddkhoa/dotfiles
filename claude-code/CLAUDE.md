## Tool Preferences
*Preferred CLI tools with specific use cases*
- **File Search**: Use `fd` over `find` - faster, respects .gitignore, better defaults
- **Text Search**: Use `rg` over `grep` - faster, respects .gitignore, better output formatting
- **Code Structure Search**: Use `ast-grep` for finding specific code patterns (classes, functions, interfaces)
- **Interactive Selection**: Use `fzf` for fuzzy finding and selecting from lists/results
- **Data Processing**: Use `jq` for JSON parsing/manipulation, `yq` for YAML/XML
- **File Listing**: Use `eza` over `ls` - better formatting, git integration, tree views
- **File Viewing**: Use `bat` over `cat` - syntax highlighting, line numbers, git integration
- **Text Processing**: Use `sed` for stream editing, `awk` for pattern scanning and processing
- **Cloud Platforms**: Use `aws` CLI for AWS, `az` CLI for Azure
- **Infrastructure**: Use `terraform` for IaC provisioning, `terraform-docs` for generating documentation

## Code Standards
*Universal principles for writing quality code*
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple. Favor simple, maintainable solutions over clever code
- **YAGNI**: You Ain't Gonna Need It. Don't implement features or abstractions until actually needed
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Extract repeated logic into utility functions
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, self-documenting names. Prefer clarity over brevity (getUserById vs getUsr)
- **Function Size**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task. Split if doing multiple things
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and fail immediately with clear errors. Don't let invalid data propagate
- **Security**: Never log/commit secrets, validate all inputs, redact sensitive data in logs
- **Imports**: Group (stdlib → third-party → local), sort alphabetically within groups
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully with meaningful, actionable messages
- **Comments**: Explain "why" decisions were made, not "what" the code does
- **Testing**: Add tests following existing project patterns before marking work complete
- **Changes**: Make minimal, focused changes that solve one problem at a time

## Communication Style
*Preferences for code, comments, and documentation*
- **No Emojis**: Never use emojis in code, comments, commit messages, or documentation
- **No Em Dashes**: Avoid em dashes (—) in writing; use hyphens (-) or restructure sentences
- **Clarity**: Write in clear, direct language without unnecessary embellishment
- **Review First**: When asked to review or analyze something, do that first and report findings before making any changes
- **Humble Language**: Avoid claiming "success" without verification. Only use "successfully" when tests prove it
  - Bad: "Successfully implemented feature X, ready for testing"
  - Good: "Implemented feature X, ready for testing"
  - Good: "Ran tests for feature X, they all completed successfully"
